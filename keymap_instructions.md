## Via

1. **Download and Install Via / Use Via in Browser**  
   - [Via official website](https://caniusevia.com/)

2. **Connect Your Keyboard**  
   - Plug in your Sea Otter Keyboard to your PC and ensure it's connected properly.
   - Please connect the USB to your computer without pressing any key switches.
(If you press and hold a key while connecting, the keyboard will enter bootloader mode. Bootloader mode is used when rewriting the entire program, not for changing keymaps. In bootloader mode, the key will not respond, and the keyboard will return to normal mode after 6 seconds.)

3. **Load the Configuration File**  
   Go to the "SETTINGS" tab > "Show Design Tab" > "DESIGN" tab > Load Draft Definition > Upload the "[SeaOtter_via.json](https://github.com/lofi-instruments/seaotter/blob/main/codes/SeaOtter_via.json)" file.

5. **Change Keymaps**  
   Go to the "CONFIGURE" tab > Click on the square representing the one key displayed at the top of the screen (the selected key will blink faintly) > From the list of keycodes at the bottom of the screen, select and click the one you want to change > Verify that the new key is assigned to the one key displayed at the top.

5. **Confirm the New Keymap**  
   Go to the "KEY TESTER" tab > Press the switch on the Sea Otter Keyboard > Confirm that the newly assigned key position turns purple on the screen.  

With that, the keymap change is complete.
