## Acrylic Base Instructions

- #### Peel off the film from the surface of the acrylic base (on both sides)
  For the film on the logo, you can apply transparent tape or similar over it and repeatedly pull it off quickly to remove it successfully.

- #### Attach the rubber feet
  Please attach the rubber feet to the four corners of the acrylic base. Make sure to attach the rubber feet to slightly raise the height of the base, as the Sea Otter Keyboard will not fit properly onto the base without this adjustment.
